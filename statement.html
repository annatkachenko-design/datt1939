  <p>Let me begin by saying that I was always interested in human relations and
		self-reflection. As a child, I even wanted to be a psychologist. The reason
		was I believed this would help me to understand myself, the loved ones, and
		to advance in life. To help satisfy my needs to understand people I did a
		lot of things such as reading books and articles,  studying psychology
		courses at university, as well as watching and listening to experts in
		this area. One of the many lessons I have learned so far is that there are
		lots of "unseen" fragments in human relationships.</p>

<p>Not only do people fail (sometimes) to understand and fully acknowledge the
	real situation and feelings other people have, but they are also blind
	(sometimes) towards aspects of their true nature and essence.   People do
	and are capable of comprehending the feelings and thoughts of others on
	multiple occasions. Human beings can sympathize, support, listen, and condole,
	but sometimes they deny, neglect, misunderstand, and dismiss those feelings.</p>

<p>We find it hard to put aside our own experiences and beliefs to analyze others
	and use this "available" information as shortcuts to make conclusions. It is
	known as confirmation bias - a situation when it is more convenient to find
	and believe in the information that supports our beliefs rather than challenges them.</p>

<p>In this work, I am going to show you a few situations where this "unseen" aspects
	of human relationships become visible and how the digital space helps reinforce
	confirmation bias.</p>
